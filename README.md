Text Based Auto-Battler.  

This is meant to be used as practice for a side project using the PyGame GUI.  It will be longer, so I needed to create a frame of reference to work from.

2/18 - This repo does not work as expected.  I've been stuck between following a method that works well for the medium versus trying to pretend it's Pygame.  Commands are passed differently in Pygame so making it work in this version does not mean it will translate over as planned.  Best option seems to be to just go with the intended medium from statrt.
